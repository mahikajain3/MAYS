## Requirements

- Create User
- Store student information in a databse (First name, Last name, netID, barcode)

- List workshops associated with each badge
- List trainings associated with each badge
- Get number of trainings/workshops attendance required per badge

## Design

- Use flask_restx to build an API server
- Handle each major requirement with an API endpoint
- Use Test-Driven-Development (TDD) to make sure we have testing
- Use Swagger for initial interaction with server
- Use Swagger, pydoc and good docstrings for documentation
